    <h1 style="background-color: sienna ;"> About raja yoga</h1>
    <p>In Sanskrit texts, Rāja yoga was both the goal of yoga and a method of attaining it. The term also became a modern name for the practice of yoga, when in the 19th-century Swami Vivekananda gave his interpretation of the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali in his book Raja Yoga</p>

        <h2>God, the Supreme Soul (Shiv Baba)</h2>
        <p>God is called the Supreme Soul or more accurate is that the Supreme Soul is known to us as the God, the creator Almighty. He is supreme among all souls. Yet, like souls, God is a subtle point of light. But unlike human Souls, that Soul is beyond the cycle of birth and death and the effects of Karma (actions) in the form of experience of pleasure or pain. God is the Supreme Father, Mother, Teacher, and Guide of all human souls. We all remember Him only in our difficult time, it is such inbuilt within us. So let us explore the truth about God, as revealed by himself through murlis.</p>
